    <h3>Questions and Answers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h4>
        <li><p>I got stuck on how to add images in HTML and I worked through it with a quick google search</p></li>

        <h4>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h4>
        <li><p>Though I was already quite comfortable with HTML basics, I re-learned how to upload images and use CSS in HTML. Everything else I was quite comfortable with doing</p></li>

        <h4>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h4>
        <li><p>The website I used for relearning how to use the image tag was <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp'>W3Schools</a> and the site I used to figure out how to use CSS in HTML was <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp'>W3Schools</a> as well. I used these resources to look at code snip-bits and apply them to my site, such as the style tag and the img tag.</p></li>

    <h2>Assignment 2 - 10/24/2022</h2>

    <h3>Questions and Answers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve these problems?</h4>
        <li><p>The challenging thing about this assignment was not knowing the margin, padding, and spacicing values. Instead I had to look at images and make an educated guess as to what those values are. Some specific problems that I had with this assignment were trying to make the labels and the input values fit on the same lines, espcially with the max and min inputs. Eventually I solved these problems by making a lot of flex boxes, testing things and seeing what works, and specificying the width of certain elements.</p></li>
        <h4>What did you learn from this assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h4>
        <li><p>From this assignment I learned how to use flexboxes and implement them in a real world scenario. A special insight that I had was to use the inspect tool to look at the names of the element that I wanted to tweak. I already knew most of the coloring, font-size and weights, and how to manipulate borders.</p></li>
        <h4>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h4>
        <li><p>Resources that I found helpful for completing the assignment are the lecture notes on flex boxes, a little google (though I did not actually google much), and the inspect tool. I used the lecture notes to make sure I understood the specific properties of flex boxes, I used google to look up specific issues I was running into (such as centering an image inside of a div) and to discover new css properties, and I used the inspect tool to see if everything was alligned and to make continuous changes to (to see what works).</p></li>
        <h4>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h4>
        <li><p>Two things I had to google was how to center an image inside of a div and how to make an element larger when hovered over.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment 3 - 11/7/2022</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://awhittle2.github.io/CS290-Assignment-3/">JavaScript Client Side</a></h3>
    
    <br>
    
    <h3>Questions and Answers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve these problems?</h4>
        <li><p>The part about this assignment that was the most challenging for me was running into JavaScript syntax errors since I did not have much experience with JavaScrip beforehand. I solved this issues by looking up the errors I got and by examining W3Schools JavaScript information.</p></li>
        <h4>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h4>
        <li><p>From this assignment, I learned a lot about the DOM and how to manipulate it with JavaScript. I did not have any insights and I already knew some JavaScript coming into this project, but I had only really utilized jQuery. Since completing this assignment, I feel much more comfortable and confident in my JavaScript skills.</p></li>
        <h4>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use these resources?</h4>
        <li><p>I found the lecture notes to be very helpful. Also google for looking up functions that I did not know exisited in JavaScript (like search or childElementCount) and runtime errors that I ran into. I mainly used W3Schools website for looking up specific JavaScript functions and did not really use any other resources.</p></li>
        <h4>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h4>
        <li><p>During this assignment, I had to Google many of the errors I kept getting. I was getting errors about how I was unable to read the checked value or that xyz function did not exsist. Ultimately I ended up fixing these errors by simply changing the way that I wrote my code. For example, I would use get by attribute instead of get element by id (on a specific element).</p></li>
